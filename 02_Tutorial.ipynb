    "Okay so we're ready to dive in with a toy VQE example. To keep things very simple we'll stick with a 1-qubit system for now. The Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix, and one of the other prerequisites for VQE which I haven't mentioned yet, is that it needs to be expressible as a sum of products of Pauli matrices (shown below for reference).\n",

That's important, because the purpose of VQE would be defeated if the prerequisites were exponentially hard to achieve.\n",

    "\n",
    "This one's easy. The math already tells us that $⟨\\sigma_i⟩_{\\Psi} = 1$ irrespective of $|\\Psi⟩$, so the whole term will just add a constant $2$ to our result.\n",

In practice, we can only measure one of the two, and we'd have to prepare the same state and do the measurement many times in order get an estimate for the true energy eigenstate (just like flipping a loaded coin many times to determine an estimate for it's true probability of giving heads).\n",

When I used to work in a lab, we would measure the state of trapped ion qubits by pointing a laser with a precise wavelength at them.

    "Congratulations! You've just learned how to code a VQE simulation example from scratch! Of course, there are a lot of differences between this and real VQE, and furthermore this has been quite different to running VQE with a proper quantum simulator. In fact, if you keep working on projects like this, you will definitely want to use a libary. For tutorials with a similar narrative to this one, but using IBM's Qiskit libary check out [this notebook](https://github.com/DavitKhach/quantum-algorithms-tutorials/blob/master/variational_quantum_eigensolver.ipynb) or [this walkthrough](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/vqe-molecules.html).\n",
